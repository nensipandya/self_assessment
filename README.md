# Self_assessment

WE did final project on Data Sceince Job Salaries.
We pulled the data from Kaggle The dataset was uploaded to Kaggle from the original Source, Ai-salaries The site is soley for Machine Learning/AI/Tech open positions and a salary database. People are able to submit their own info to add it to the dataset.

In this Final project, our goal is to find the top 3 job positions and salary associated with it. We also try to predict the future of the data analyst job, whether it is going to increase in the future or what?

Questions will include:

Average change in salary per year (Cecelia)

Salary based on company size (David)

Salary comparison for remote vs in-office positions. (Kinjal)

Salary comparison for Top 3 positions (Nensi) 

For Salary comparison prediction, I used Random Forest Machine Learning and get 69% accuracy. I also tried neural network machine learning model, but did not any success.
